You will use elemental concepts such as data structures, conditional statements and functions, amongst others. To do so, you will use the following Jupyter Notebook as a template."

    "## Creating a Basic Python Program\n",
    "You have to create a basic program that enables the user **FIVE** options:\n",
    "1. Input your name and id number. Then, the program has to print a message greeting you with your name and the addition of the digits that compose your id number.\n",
    "2. Count and print the number of letter $a$ in your name.\n",
    "3. Create a list called *students* where the user can store any number of names (you have to guarantee that no name is entered twice). Then, create a list called *marks* where the user can store an equal amount of numbers between 0 and 10 (decimals marks must be allowed).\n",
    "4. The user specifies a name, and the program has to check if that student exists (i.e. if it is in the *students* list). If true, the program prints the mark corresponding to the student (i.e. the number in the *marks* list located in the same position as the student's name in the *students* list). Else, the program prints an error message. If the user tries a name three consecutive times and is unsuccessful, then the function is terminated and the program returns to the main menu.\n",
    "5. Exit the program."
