    "Each student will be assigned a different dataset in a *comma separated value* (*.csv*) format. The main goal is to import such dataset into Python so that you can wrangle and visualise the data in better ways. This will allow you to get your own conclusions and start building up knowledge regarding on how you could potentially learn from data to predict or classify future instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create a program which allows you to select from the following options:\n",
    "1. Import and print your dataset into Python as a numpy array.\n",
    "2. Query and print an instance of the dataset by row number or by id (i.e. first column of the table).\n",
    "3. Create a \"reduced\" dataset (i.e. with less columns) by indicating a list of column names to bring upon this newly created dataset.\n",
    "4. Plot the dataset by means of a scatterplot which relates two columns specified by the user. The plot has to show the $x$ and $y$ axis labels as the chosen columns, and use the *target/class* column (i.e. the last one) as the colour variable.\n",

Using any of the two continuous variables of your dataset, using a cell code show an example of how a **linear regression** could be applied with your dataset to predict the values of future entries of data without target/class (you can implement linear regressions using existing Python modules).
