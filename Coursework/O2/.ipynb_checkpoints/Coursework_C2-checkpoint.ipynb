    "## Importing and Visualising a Business Case in Python\n",
    "Each student will be assigned a different dataset in a different format. The goal is to import the dataset into Python so that you can wrangle and visualise the data in better ways. This will allow you to get your own conclusions and start building up knowledge regarding on how you could potentially learn from data to predict or classify future instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create a program which allows you to select the following options:\n",
    "1. Import your dataset into the Python environment.\n",
    "2. Query and print an instance of the dataset (by row number or by row name).\n",
    "3. Create a new dataset with less columns by indicating a list of columns to bring upon a new reduced dataset.\n",
    "4. Randomly split the dataset into two substes called *training* and *testing* according to a ratio specified by the user.\n",
    "5. Visualise a dataset using a scatterplot which relates two variables specified by the user.\n",
    "    1. The user shall also be capable to specify the chart title and the $x$ and $y$ labels, as well as a fixed colour and size for the dots in the plot.\n",
    "    2. Alternatively, the user may SPECIFY the *TARGET/CLASS* column as the colour differentiator. If that is the case, then the program has to show the user the targets/classes and ask the user to specify a colour for each target/class.\n",
    "6. Exit the program."

    "* The program has to check that every input option added by the user is valid.\n",
    "* No option can be executed until option 1 is executed first.\n",
    "* Whenever a dataset or subdataset is imported or created, print it for the user to visually inspect it.\n",
    "* In option 2, the row to query can be specified either using the row number or the row name.\n",
    "* In option 3, the list of columns has to be specified by column name.\n",
    "* Option 5 can receive as input either the original dataset or the training/testing ones (if these have been already created).\n"

    "* Name both the Jupyter notebook and the html/pdf file with your id number and submit them to the corresponding Moodle's dropbox before **12th December, 2019**."
