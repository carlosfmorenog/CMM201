You will use elemental concepts such as data structures, conditional statements and functions, amongst others. To do so, you will use the following Jupyter Notebook as a template."

    "1. Input your name and id number. Then, the program has to print a message greeting you with your name and the addition of the digits that compose your id number.\n",
    "2. Count and print the number of letter $a$ in your name.\n",
    "3. Create a numpy array with $n$ rows, $m$ columns and random numbers (from 1 to 10) as the content. The values $n$ and $m$ are defined by the user, and the value of $n$ can't be larger than $m$. Otherwise, the user has to try again. Once the numpy array is created, print it for the user.\n",
    "4. Print the value of a specific position of the numpy array. This function has to check that both the values of the row and the column where the user wants to get the value are valid (this means that the row and column to query have to be equal or smaller than the shape of the numpy array). Otherwise, the user has to try again.\n",
